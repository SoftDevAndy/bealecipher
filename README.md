Starting point for finding the mystery of the Thomas Beale Cipher

### ***About***

Back in 1885 a collection of Ciphers was circulated with the promise of the location of the treasure if the Ciphers was ever to be solved. More then likely the **treasure was a hoax** pulled by the publisher to make some quick cash off hopeful treasure hunters. Some have claimed to have found the treasure while others deny its existence (I'm of this mind). It's a very interesting read through.

The following project is a starting point for parsing the cipher ***.csv*** files and building up a frequency map of the occurrence of repeated numbers.
